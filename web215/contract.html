            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <p>I, <a href="/web215/introduction.html">Connor Emery</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB215-N801 Advanced Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.</p>

              <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.</p>
                
                <p>I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
                
                <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.</p>
                
                <p>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
                
                <p>Signed: <em>Connor Emery</em>, 20 January 2025</p>
