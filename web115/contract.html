			<h2>Contract</h2>
					<title>Contract</title>	
					<p>I, <a class="link" href="./introduction.html">Connor Emery</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.</p>
					<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
					I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
					<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
					As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
					<p>Signed: <i>Connor Emery, 18 August 2024</i></p>
