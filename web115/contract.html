			<h2>Contract</h2>
					<p>I, <a href="./introduction.html">Connor Emery</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB-115 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.</p>
					<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.
					I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
					<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
					As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
					<p>Signed:    <em>Connor Emery, 18 August 2024</em></p>
