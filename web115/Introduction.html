            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I am a 20 year old college student and I havent worked anywhere longer than 2 months :'( I am actively searching for work now! perhaps a help desk job or something part time as I need to divert all my time and focus towards coding and programming.</p>

            <h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
            <p>Less than a year of coding under my belt, one or two classes at central piedmont and all the information ive gathered from having a father in IT, so a good general understanding of PC and Network systems</p>
