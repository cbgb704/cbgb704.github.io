            <p>NC born and raised! </p>

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I am a 20 year old college student and I havent worked anywhere longer than 2 months :'( I am actively searching for work now! perhaps a help desk job or something part time as I need to divert all my time and focus towards coding and programming.</p>

            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>I am pursuing 2 associates degrees with central piedmont, an associate in arts to be eligable for the college transfer program, and a associate in applied science in the focus of full stack programming</p>

            <h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
            <p>Less than a year of coding under my belt, one or two classes at central piedmont and all the information ive gathered from having a father in IT, so a good general understanding of PC and Network systems</p>

            <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
            <p>Recently got a gaming laptop for my birthday! Its specifically a Predator Helios Neo 16 with intel core 17 processor and a geforce 4060, and I am most familiar with windows OS but would like to learn linux. Best present to date (save for the hat my wife made me <3)</p>

            <h3>This Course Should</h3>
            <p>If you could project what this course SHOULD teach you to better prepare you for life’s experience (both what you want to happen and what could happen) what would you like to see it teach you?</p>

            <h3>My Positive and Negative Potential</h3>
            <p>Computers are basically advanced tools, like any other tools - and can be used to create and destroy, attach and divide. How do you plan on using your increased abilities with computers to build (positive actions), and how could you end up using them to destroy (i.e., negatively)?</p>
