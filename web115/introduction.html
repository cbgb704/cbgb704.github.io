        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Personal Background</h3>
            <p>NC born and raised! </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I am a 20 year old college student and I havent worked anywhere longer than 2 months :'( I am actively searching for work now! perhaps a help desk job or something part time as I need to divert all my time and<br>focus towards coding and programming.</p>
           
            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>I am pursuing 2 associates degrees with central piedmont, an associate in arts to be eligable for the college transfer<br>program, and a associate in applied science in the focus of full stack programming.</p>

            <h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
            <p>Less than a year of coding under my belt, one or two classes at central piedmont and all the information ive gathered from having a father in IT, so a good general understanding of PC and Network systems.</p>

            <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
            <p>Recently got a gaming laptop for my birthday! Its specifically a Predator Helios Neo 16 with Intel core 17 processor and a GeForce 4060, and I am most familiar with Windows OS but would like to learn Linux. Best present to date (save for the hat my wife made me you can see above).</p>

            <h2>Courses</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><h3>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting </h3></li>
            <p>Definitely a little daunting starting to program again, I feel like I'm behind which never feels good, but im optimistic and eager to learn!</p>

            <li><h3>CTS240 - Project Management</h3></li>
            <p>I need this course for my degree, as well as to help me get a grasp on working with a team and how my career will look in the future.</p>

            <li><h3>CSC154 - Software Development</h3></li>
            <p>Particularly excited about this class too, curious to see whether I enjoy software or webpage design more, excited about both but have more experience with websites.</p>
