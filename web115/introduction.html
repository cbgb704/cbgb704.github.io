                <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                <p>I am a 20-year-old college student and haven't worked anywhere longer than 2 months :'( I am actively searching for work now! Perhaps a help desk job or something part-time as I need to divert all my time and focus towards coding and programming.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Academic Background</h3>
                <p>I am pursuing 2 associates degrees with Central Piedmont, an associate in arts for the college transfer program, and an associate in applied science with a focus on full-stack programming.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
                <p>Less than a year of coding under my belt, one or two classes at Central Piedmont, and general knowledge from my father in IT. I have a good general understanding of PC and network systems.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
                <p>Recently got a gaming laptop for my birthday! It's a Predator Helios Neo 16 with an Intel Core i7 processor and a GeForce 4060. I am most familiar with Windows OS but would like to learn Linux. Best present to date (besides the hat my wife made me, as seen above).</p>

                        <h5><strong>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting</strong></h5>
                        <p>Definitely a little daunting starting to program again. I feel like I'm behind, but I’m optimistic and eager to learn!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>CTS240 - Project Management</strong></h5>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5><strong>CSC154 - Software Development</strong></h5>
                        <p>I'm particularly excited about this class, curious to see whether I enjoy software or webpage design more, though I have more experience with websites.</p>
