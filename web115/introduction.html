                <strong>Personal Background:</strong>
                
                NC born and raised!

                <strong>Professional Background:</strong>
                I am a 20-year-old college student and haven't worked anywhere longer than 2 months :'( I am actively searching for work now! Perhaps a help desk job or something part-time as I need to divert all my time and focus towards coding and programming.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <strong>Academic Background:</strong>
                I am pursuing 2 associates degrees with Central Piedmont, an associate in arts for the college transfer program, and an associate in applied science with a focus on full-stack programming.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>
                Less than a year of coding under my belt, one or two classes at Central Piedmont, and general knowledge from my father in IT. I have a good general understanding of PC and network systems.
            </li>

                <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>
                Recently got a gaming laptop for my birthday! It's a Predator Helios Neo 16 with an Intel Core i7 processor and a GeForce 4060. I am most familiar with Windows OS but would like to learn Linux. Best present to date (besides the hat my wife made me, as seen above).

                        <strong><a id="web115" href="contract.html">WEB115</a> - Web Markup and Scripting:</strong>
                        Definitely a little daunting starting to program again. I feel like I'm behind, but I’m optimistic and eager to learn!

                        <strong>CTS240 - Project Management:</strong>
This course is essential for my degree and will help me understand teamwork and what my career will look like in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CSC154 - Software Development:</strong>
                        I'm particularly excited about this class, curious to see whether I enjoy software or webpage design more, though I have more experience with websites.
