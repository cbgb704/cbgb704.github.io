            <h3>Personal Background</h3>
            <p>NC born and raised! </p>

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I am a 20 year old college student and I havent worked anywhere longer than 2 months :'( I am actively searching for work now! perhaps a help desk job or something part time as I need to divert all my time and focus towards coding and programming.</p>

            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>I am pursuing 2 associates degrees with central piedmont, an associate in arts to be eligable for the college transfer program, and a associate in applied science in the focus of full stack programming</p>

            <h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
            <p>Less than a year of coding under my belt, one or two classes at central piedmont and all the information ive gathered from having a father in IT, so a good general understanding of PC and Network systems</p>

            <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
            <p>Recently got a gaming laptop for my birthday! Its specifically a Predator Helios Neo 16 with Intel core 17 processor and a GeForce 4060, and I am most familiar with Windows OS but would like to learn Linux. Best present to date (save for the hat my wife made me you can see above)</p>

            <p>I need this course for my degree, as well as to help me get a grasp on </p>
