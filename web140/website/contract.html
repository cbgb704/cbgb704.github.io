            <a href="/web140/website/contract.html">Contract</a>
            <p>I, Connor Emery agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2025, WEB140-N801 Web Development Tools with my instructor, Ella McManus.

              I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
              
              I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
              
              <br>Signed: Connor Emery, 1/22/25</p>
